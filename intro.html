        The Accord.NET Framework is a software framework to aid building scientific computing
        applications. If you are doing research, and would like to quickly experiment with
        old and new machine learning techniques, this framework is for you. But if you would
        like to build neat stuff, including commercial products taking advantage of modern
        pattern recognition techniques, then this framework is for you too.
    </p>
    <p>
        This framework has been crafted with two goals in mind: extensibility and interoperability.
        Extensibility is achieved through the careful use of common interfaces to model
        common problems, such as learning algorithms and machine learning models. Maximum
        interoperability is achieved by minimizing dependencies on (externally visible)
        data structures and focusing on what is already present in the .NET framework. This
        may be most easily seen by inspecting the framework's <a href="docs/html/T_Accord_Math_Matrix.htm">
            matrix library</a> and the way it operates over standard .NET components using
        extension methods. This means the framework can be used <i>alongside</i> other libraries
        and frameworks with minimum impendance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The framework comes with more than 40 different statistical distributions which
        can be plugged in the most varying methods (such as Hidden Markov Models) and can
        be combined in a number of ways to create a possibly infinite number of mixture
        and joint distributions. The presence of more than 30 hypothesis tests also assures
        you will be able to validate your results with ease, even for contingency tables
        or multivariate observations. For machine learning applications, there are also
        more than 38 kernel functions to chose from.

        Then what can I do with it?</h1>

        You can toy around:</p>

        But you can do some serious business too:</p>

    <h1>
        And <i>how</i> can I do any of this?</h1>
    <p>
        The easiest path to build your own application with the framework is to get one
        of the sample applications that most resembles what you are trying to do and run
        with it. The sample application library demonstrates many of the framework features
        with simple problems. Those applications include examples ranging from statistics
        data preprocessing (such as applying statistical analysis, including PCA, KDA, LDA,
        PLS), image processing (such as image categorization, corners detection, image stiching),
        audio processing (data gathering, blind source separation), to depth image processing
        using Microsoft's Kinect.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't find a sample application that is closer to what you are trying to
        do, don't be afraid of <a href="http://accord-net.github.io/docs/Index.html">checking
            the documentation</a>: code examples, <a href="/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_MulticlassSupportVectorLearning.htm">
                such as those</a>, may be able to help.
    </p>
    <p>
        And finally, if neither of those could fulfill your needs, you are more than welcome
        to use the discussion groups and post your question!
