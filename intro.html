    <h1>
        The Accord.NET Framework</h1>
    <p>
        Accord.NET is a framework for scientific computing in .NET. The framework builds
        upon AForge.NET, an also popular framework for image processing, supplying new tools
        and libraries. Those libraries encompass a wide range of scientific computing applications,
        such as statistical data processing, machine learning, pattern recognition, including
        but not limited to, computer vision and computer audition. The framework offers
        a large number of probability distributions, hypothesis tests, kernel functions
        and support for most popular performance measurements techniques.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Structural organization</h1>
    <p>
        The framework is divided in libraries, available either through an executable installer,
        standalone compressed archives and <a href="http://nuget.org/packages?q=Accord.NET"
            rel="nofollow">NuGet packages</a>. Those libraries include:

        Sample applications
    </h1>
    <p>
        The framework comes with a library of sample applications so you can start writing
        code earlier. Applications range from statistics data preprocessing (statistical
        analysis, including PCA, KDA, LDA, PLS), image processing (image categorization,
        corners detection, image stitching), audio processing (data gathering, blind source
        separation), to video processing (depth image analysis with Microsoft's Kinect).
