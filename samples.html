                Fourier</h2>
            <p>
                A simple audio spectrum analyzer using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Can optionally
                use audio windows (i.e. Hamming) to reduce bin leakage in the spectrum.</p>

                Beat Detector</h2>
            <p>
                A simple beat detector which listens to the default input device and tries to detect
                peaks in the audio signal. It is a statistics based beat detector in the sense it
                searches local energy peaks which may contain a beat. The application also demonstrates
                the usage of the Metronome class of the framework, which allows one to detect the
                current tempo by "tapping" the metronome.</p>
