                A simple beat detector which listens to the default input device and tries to detect
                peaks in the audio signal. It is a statistics based beat detector in the sense it
                searches local energy peaks which may contain a beat. The application also demonstrates
                the usage of the Metronome class of the framework, which allows one to detect the
                current tempo by "tapping" the metronome.</p>

                    using the Bag of Visual Words (BoW) model with SURF features and the Binary Split

                <p>
                    The BoW model is used to transform the many SURF feature points in a image in a
                    single, fixed-length feature vector. The feature vector is then used to train a
                    Support Vector Machine (SVM) using a variety of kernels.</p>

                    which is only needed for Harris. The Nobel measure does not require setting any
