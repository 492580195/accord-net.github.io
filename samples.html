                A simple audio spectrum analyzer using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Can optionally
                use audio windows (i.e. Hamming) to reduce bin leakage in the spectrum.</p>

                Listens to the default input device and tries to detect peaks in the audio signal.
                It is a statistics based beat detector in the sense it searches local energy peaks
                which may contain a beat. Also demonstrates the usage of the Metronome class of
                the framework, which allows one to detect the current tempo by "tapping" the metronome.</p>

                Shows how to perform image classification using the Bag of Visual Words (BoW) model
                with SURF features and the Binary Split algorithm.</p>
            <p>
                The BoW model is used to transform the many SURF feature points in a image in a
                single, fixed-length feature vector. The feature vector is then used to train a
                Support Vector Machine (SVM) using a variety of kernels.</p>

                Demonstrates how to perform corners detection using the FAST corners detector. As
                the name implies, the FAST detector is one of the fastest corners detectors available
                in the framework.</p>

                Demonstrates how to perform corners detection using Harris' operator. The current
                implementation supports both Harris and Nobel corner measures. Harris can be enabled
                by ticking the checkbox next to the 'k' parameter, which is only needed for Harris.
                The Nobel measure does not require setting any parameters.</p>

                Screencast Capture Lite is a tool for recording the desktop screen and saving it
                to a video file, preserving quality as much as possible. It is a real application,
                and also a demonstration of the use of the AForge.NET and Accord.NET Frameworks
                to build multimedia applications, capturing video and audio streams from different
                sources.
