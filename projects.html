    <p>
        If you have interest in using Accord.NET and AForge.NET features
        in your Windows Phone or Windows Store application, then please 
        check out the <a href="https://github.com/cureos/accord" target="_new">
        CureOS fork</a> by <a href="https://github.com/cureos">Anders Gustafsson</a>.
        This project is a port of both frameworks to run on the Portable Class Library 
        classes, the .NET subset that powers WinRT.

    <p>
        If you are very interested in one of the capabilities offered by
        Accord.NET and AForge.NET, but would like to work on Java, then
        please check out the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/catalano-framework/">
        Catalano Framework</a>, a port of both frameworks to the Java Platform 
        created by Diego Catalano. His <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/656059/Catalano-Framework">
        article presenting and describing his framework on CodeProject</a> received
        a best-article award in November; and in this article it can be seen how many
        of the image processing capabilities present in both frameworks (plus a many 
        extra original implementations) can already be found on his project.

        If you are interested in more advanced algorithms, such as optical flow, particle
        tracking and other extensions for the AForge.NET and Accord.NET Framework, take a
        look at the <a href="https://github.com/dajuric/accord-net-extensions">Accord.NET
        Extensions project</a> being developed by Darko Juri&cacute;. The project implements
        Kalman Filters, the Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi feature tracker, among other algorithms and
        usage extensions.
