    <h1>The framework is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">
            GNU Lesser Public License v2.1</a></h1>
    <p>
       What does that means?
    </p>

    <small>Note: I am not a lawyer, and the following should not be seen, by any means,
        as any kind of legal advice. They do not substitute the license text, and the only
        valid legal terms are the ones specified in the contents of the GNU Lesser General
        Public License text file. If in doubt, consult a lawyer.</small>

    <h2>
        Can I use Accord.NET in my commercial applications?</h2>
    <p>
        Absolutely <strong>yes</strong>. But restrictions may apply, and you might want
        to check the actual license text for those details.</p>
    <h2>
        Will I need to disclose my source code if I link against this library?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No</strong>, as long as you don't touch any of the framework's own source
        code files. If you just link against the framework .dll files, then everything should
        be fine. Note that this is the most common case (and the intended use) scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if you make modifications to the framework <i>source code</i>, and redistribute
        this modified version (i.e. compile a modified version of <i>the framework itself</i>),
        then you will need to distribute those modifications under the LGPL, to whomever
        you chose to distribute this modified version to.
    </p>
    <h2>
        So if I alter any of the framework's source code files and link against this modified
        version, will I have to disclose my application code?
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No</strong>. Your application would be fine. The problem would be the modified
        version of the framework: if you would like to continue using the framework, you
        can open just the modifications you made to the framework's source code, and not
        the code of your consumer application.</p>
    <p>
        Also, please note that neither the GPL nor the LGPL obligate you to disclose your
        code. If you distribute a modified version without abiding by the LGPL terms, you
        will be violating the license terms and thus lose your grant to continue using the
        library. Most likely you will have two options: continue using the library and disclose
        your modifications under the LGPL, or stop distributing the modified software altogether.

    <h1>
        Additional software</h1>
    <p>
        Great part of the open-source software ecosystem is based in the sharing and reuse
        of source code. As such, the framework also makes use of several excelent works
        shared by other users under LGPL-compatible licenses. For a complete list of such
        software, please consult the <a href="https://github.com/accord-net/framework/blob/master/Copyright.txt">
            Copyrights.txt text file</a> in the framework's main folder.
