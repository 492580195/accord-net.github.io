    <h2>
        How fast is Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Users often find the SVM learning algorithm to take too much time. This, however,
        may be a reflection of the particular choice of learning parameters. For instance,
        attempting to create a hard-margin SVM (with very high <a href="http://accord-net.github.io/docs/html/P_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimization_Complexity.htm">
            complexity parameter C</a>) using a linear kernel in a non-linearly separable
        dataset will diverge and possibly lead to an infinite loop. In those cases, consider
        using the automatic parameter estimation routines in <a href="http://accord-net.github.io/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimization.htm">
            SequentialMinimalOptimization</a> and in the choosen Kernel function. Values
        returned by those routines may lead to more sparse machines and faster training
        times.

        For best initial results, please set the <a href="/docs/html/P_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimization_UseComplexityHeuristic.htm">
            UseComplexityHeuristic</a> property of the <a href="http://accord-net.github.io/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimization.htm">
                SMO learning algorithm</a> to true when learning your initial machine. This
        will give you an indication of an appropriate running time for your problem. Also,
        if you are using <a href="http://accord-net.github.io/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Kernels_Gaussian.htm">
            Gaussian kernels</a>, try estimating the kernel parameters from the data using
        the <a href="http://accord-net.github.io/docs/html/M_Accord_Statistics_Kernels_Gaussian_Estimate.htm">
            Gaussian.Estimate</a> static method of your kernel's class. The initial values
        returned from those heuristics can be used as a starting point for hyperparameter
        tuning.

        Why I am getting <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.outofmemoryexception.aspx">
            OutOfMemoryExceptions</a> when training my Vector Machines?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The framework automatically builds a kernel function cache to help speed up computations
        during SVM learning. However, there are cases that this cache may take too much
        memory and lead to such exceptions. To make a balance between memory comsumption
        and CPU speed, set the <a href="http://accord-net.github.io/docs/html/P_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimization_CacheSize.htm">
            CacheSize</a> property to a lower value. The default is to store all input vectors
        in the cache; setting it to something lower (such as 1/20 the number of training
        samples might help.

        Why can't I open Excel worksheets using ExcelReader?
    </h2>
    <p>
        To open Excel files, you have to install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255">
            Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable</a>, available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255">
                here</a>. This engine, also known as ACE, is a replacement for JET, the
        old ODBC driver which could be used to open Excel 2003 workbooks. In order to use
        ACE in both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, you need to install both redistributables
        from the Microsoft website. To install them both, you need to use the /passive command
        line switch to prevent the installation from failing once it detects another component
        version already installed. After downloading the executables, run:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>C:\Users\You\Downloads\AccessDatabaseEngine.exe /passive</li>
        <li>C:\Users\You\Downloads\AccessDatabaseEngine_x64.exe /passive</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Why am I getting "non-positive definite" or "variance is zero" exceptions when I
        am trying to estimate my model?
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you enconter any of the exceptions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Variance is zero. Try specifying a regularization constant in the fitting options",
            or</li>
        <li>"Covariance matrix is not positive definite. Try specifying a regularization constant
            in the fitting options"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This might be a sign that the problem you are trying to solve is a tricky one, or
        the model that is being assumed is not a very likely candidate for the samples you
        have.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the possible reasons for those exceptions is the presence of a constant column
        in your data (i.e. a column that only has the same value). This is a problem because
        the standard deviation (or variance) for such variables will be zero, and any methods
        making the assumption that the variance will be strictly positive (i.e. Gaussian
        models) will fail. One possible way to overcome this situation is to add a regularization
        constant to the variance calculations; this way the variance will be very small,
        but will be different from zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that the addition of this constant will likely reduce the accuracy of
        your models. But since the models were already making wrong assumptions about your
        data, this could be an indication that other models may be more indicated for your
        particular problem after all.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a final note, the way on how to add this regularization constant depends on the
        model being estimated; but most likely the solution for this problem would involve
        creating a <a href="/docs/html/AllMembers_T_Accord_Statistics_Distributions_Fitting_NormalOptions.htm">
            NormalOptions</a> object, setting its <a href="/docs/html/P_Accord_Statistics_Distributions_Fitting_NormalOptions_Regularization.htm">
                Regularization</a> property to some small value, and pass it along to the
        model fitting algorithm. For examples involving Hidden Markov Models, please see
        <a href="/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Models_Markov_Learning_BaumWelchLearning_1.htm">
            the examples on the BaumWelchLearning</a> documentation page.
